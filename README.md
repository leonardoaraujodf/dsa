# Data Structures and Algorithms Questions

This list is a list of resolutions to some common questions related to data structures and algorithms. The leetcode questions have their discuss tab where there is *probably* better and way more explained resolutions to those problems. Use this as a starting point. The strategy column refers to common strategies used to solve the problems. You might look for similar problems using the strategy column if you want to study about a specific topic.

## Suggestions

If you haven't study about the topics one by one, don't just go randomly selecting questions and trying to solve them because you *probably* will get frustrated (believe me I did that). Choose a topic, study a few questions related to it (start with the easy ones, them go to the medium ones), then go to the next topic.
